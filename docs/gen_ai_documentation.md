# Data Sage
## Problem Statement
In the era of big data, organizations often collect vast amounts of structured data but lack the technical expertise or time to extract actionable insights. Traditional data analysis tools require knowledge of programming languages like Python and frameworks like pandas, creating a barrier for non-technical users or decision-makers. This gap between data availability and actionable insight hinders timely decision-making and reduces the overall value derived from data.

There is a pressing need for a user-friendly, intelligent system that allows users—regardless of their technical background—to explore, understand, and interact with their data efficiently.
